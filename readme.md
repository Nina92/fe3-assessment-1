# Assessment 1

## Description
For Assessment 1 of Frontend 3 I've made a basic visualisation from given data. 
I made a D3 bar chart based on [Mike Bostock's code for a Bar Chart with Negative Values](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2368837) and I used the cleaned data from [knmi.nl](https://www.knmi.nl/kennis-en-datacentrum/achtergrond/gehomogeniseerde-reeks-maandtemperaturen-de-bilt) about monthly temperature time series.

## Background
First, I copied the HTML code from Mike Bostock's D3 Bar Chart with Negative Values code. Then I removed the internal CSS and JavaScript and placed them in external files. I downloaded de CSV file from GitHub and linked it to the JS file.

In the original code, the first column of the dataset was labeled _name_ and the second column was labeled _value_. The given dataset used the labels _date_ and _temp_. Therefore, in the JavaScript file I replaced the words _name_ (that refered to the label) with _date_ and I replaced the words _value_ (that refered to the label) with _temp_.

At first it looked like only the first row of the dataset was shown. I only saw the date and I saw no bars at all. After a little thinking and looking at the console I discovered that the reason the chart was like this was that the given height of the SVG element was way too small for a dataset with so many rows. So I changed that value so that all the bars were visible.

I gave the bars a bit more padding by increasing the rangeRoundBands of the y-axis from 0.1 to 0.3. I also tweaked the colors a bit so that the bars with negative values are blue  (cold temperature) and the bars with positive values are orange (warm temperature). I gave them both a darker shade when you hover on them.

I wanted labels for the axis that said _date (YYYYMMDD)_ for the y-axis and _temperature (â„ƒ)_ for the x-axis. [Mike Bostock's Line Chart](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3883245) has a label for the y-axis. So I used that part of code to create my own labels and positioned them nicely.

At last I added comments in the JavaScript file in which I explain in Dutch what the code does.
